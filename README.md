This repository includes two Stata .do files to replicate EPAR's analysis of gender-associated differences in risk attitudes and perceptions in Mali. To run the analysis locally, open the .do file and change the directory filepaths as necessary.

The .do file also includes code for data cleaning and variable construction. The data are from the "Farmer First" study in Mali, collected by TNS International for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2010. We have uploaded a copy of the raw data from this survey.
