# 340-Farmer-First-Gender-Attitudes

This repository includes Stata .do files developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) for the analysis of factors associated with risk attitudes and perceptions using data from the Farmer First household survey. These files were developed as part EPAR Technical Report #340, Gender-Associated Differences in Risk Attitudes and Perceptions among Farmers in Mali: https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar/research/gender-associated-differences-risk-attitudes-and-perceptions 

This repository includes two Stata .do files to replicate EPAR's analysis. To run the analysis locally, open the .do file and change the directory filepaths as necessary. The .do files also include code for data cleaning and variable construction. The data are from the "Farmer First" study in Mali, collected by TNS International for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2010. We have uploaded a copy of the raw data from this survey.

To access the .do files, either clone this repository or click on the green "Clone or Download" button and choose "Download zip".
